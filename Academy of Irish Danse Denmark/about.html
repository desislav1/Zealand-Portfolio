                        <h1>What is Riverdance</h1>
                        <p>Riverdance is a theatrical show consisting mainly of traditional Irish music and dance.
                            With a score composed by Bill Whelan, it originated as an interval performance act during
                            the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest, featuring Irish dancing champions Jean Butler, Michael
                            Flatley and the vocal ensemble Anúna. Shortly afterwards, husband and wife production team
                            John McColgan and Moya Doherty expanded it into a stage show, which opened in Dublin on
                            9 February 1995. Since then, the show has visited over 450 venues worldwide and been
                            seen by over 25 million people, making it one of the most successful dance productions
                            in the world.

                        <h1>History of Riverdance</h1>
                        <p>Riverdance was first performed during the seven-minute interval of the 1994 Eurovision Song
                            Contest
                            at the Point Theatre in Dublin on 30 April 1994. The performance was transmitted to an
                            estimated 300
                            million viewers worldwide and earned a standing ovation from the packed theatre of 4,000
                            people.
                            The performance is often considered the most well known interval act in Eurovision Song
                            Contest history.
                            Riverdance was later performed as an interval act at both the Congratulations: 50 Years of
                            the Eurovision
                            Song Contest (2005) and Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits (2015) events.
                            Thirteen years later, Whelan
                            was invited to do the intermission piece for another Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin,
                            and composed Riverdance. In a book about Planxty (The Humours of Planxty, by Leagues
                            O'Toole),
                            Whelan says, "It was no mistake of mine to call it Riverdance because it connected
                            absolutely to Timedance"
